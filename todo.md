- [x] Select appropriate technologies for backend (Flask), frontend (React for web, React Native for mobile), and database (PostgreSQL)
- [x] Consider mobile compatibility (React Native for cross-platform)
- [x] Outline key features and how they map to the chosen technologies
  - User Authentication (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native)
  - User Profiles (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native, DB: PostgreSQL)
  - Location-based User Discovery (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native, DB: PostgreSQL, External: Mapping API)
  - Messaging with 3-message limit (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native, DB: PostgreSQL, Real-time: WebSockets)
  - Meetup Nudging (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native)
  - Feedback System (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native, DB: PostgreSQL)
  - Upgrade Perks (Backend: Flask, Frontend: React/React Native, DB: PostgreSQL)

### Phase 2: Design database schema and API endpoints
- [x] Design the database schema for users, profiles, messages, and meetups
- [x] Define RESTful API endpoints for all necessary functionalities

### Phase 3: Build backend API with Flask
- [x] Set up Flask project
- [x] Implement user authentication and authorization
- [x] Develop API endpoints for user management, profile creation, location updates, and messaging
- [x] Integrate with the chosen database

### Phase 4: Create responsive web frontend with React
- [x] Set up React project
- [x] Design and implement user interface for sign-up, login, profile, and nearby users display
- [x] Implement messaging interface
- [x] Add Google Sign-In functionality
- [x] Create rich, sophisticated logos
- [x] Test authentication flow end-to-end

### Phase 5: Implement location services and mapping
- [x] Integrate with a mapping service (e.g., Google Maps API)
- [x] Implement real-time location tracking and updating
- [x] Develop logic for finding nearby users
- [x] Add geolocation API integration to frontend
- [x] Create location-based user discovery
- [x] Add location storage and retrieval in backend
- [x] Implement proximity calculations

### Phase 6: Add real-time messaging functionality
- [x] Implement real-time messaging using WebSockets or similar technology
- [x] Enforce the 3-message limit before meeting or upgrade
- [x] Create conversation management system
- [x] Build message interface with limit warnings
- [x] Add meetup proposal functionality
- [x] Test complete messaging flow

### Phase 7: Test application locally and fix issues
- [x] Conduct unit tests for backend and frontend components
- [x] Perform integration testing for end-to-end functionality
- [x] Debug and fix any identified issues
- [x] Test complete user flow from signup to messaging
- [x] Verify mobile responsiveness across different screen sizes
- [x] Test 3-message limit enforcement and upgrade prompts
- [x] Validate location services and user discovery
- [x] Test profile management and data persistence
- [x] Verify all navigation and UI components
- [x] Create comprehensive test report

### Phase 8: Deploy application to production
- [x] Prepare backend for deployment (e.g., Gunicorn, Nginx)
- [x] Deploy backend API to a cloud platform
- [x] Deploy frontend to a hosting service
- [x] Remove bcrypt dependency for production compatibility
- [x] Update frontend to use production API endpoints
- [x] Test production deployment
- [x] Backend deployed to: https://dyh6i3cvkwme.manus.space
- [x] Frontend deployed to: https://segiztlq.manus.space

### Phase 9: Deliver final application and documentation
- [x] Provide instructions for setting up and running the application
- [x] Create comprehensive technical documentation
- [x] Create user guide and onboarding materials
- [x] Document API endpoints and usage
- [x] Provide deployment information and URLs
- [x] Create business model and future roadmap documentation
- [x] Include privacy, safety, and security information
- [x] Deliver complete project with all deliverables
- [ ] Document API endpoints and database schema
- [ ] Present the working application to the user
